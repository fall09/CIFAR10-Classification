# CIFAR10-Classification

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Contents
- **cifar_10.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook file with step-by-step implementation of the model.
- **cifar_10.py**: A Python script version of the same implementation.

## Features
- Dataset: CIFAR-10 (10 image classes: Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck)
- Model: Convolutional Neural Network
- Framework: TensorFlow/Keras

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fall09/CIFAR10-Classification.git
   ```
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy
   ```
3. Open the `cifar_10.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or run `cifar_10.py` directly.

## Results
The model achieves approximately **70% accuracy** on the test dataset.
